# Trigonometric-Height-and-Distance-Calculator

A simple python based program that can calculate Height and Distance using trigonometric function tan.

It also gives you the tan theta of a given angle, considered as AngleX as input.

# Input:-

 Distance calculation :

    Enter the Angle = 45
    Enter the Height/Opposite side =25

# Output:-

 Results :

    tan of given angle  =  1.0
    Distance/Adjacent side =  25.0

Same for Calculating Height; the only difference is that it says you Enter the value  Object/Opposite side.

You can add other types of Trigonometric functions, too, such as Sin, Cos etc. By looking at the program.
